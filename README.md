## Welcome to my Profile!

I hope that you stick around for a while.

### Programming and Markup languages

I can program in Python3, Java, JavaScript with Node and some proprietary languages like CAPL. 
I also use Markup languages like HTML and CSS, Markdown and LaTeX almost daily.

### Current projects

I'm currently working on my own discord bot and multiple linux server management tools.

### About me

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about music, server management and internet services.
- ðŸŒˆ My pronouns are they/them.
- âš¡ Fun fact: About 90% of fun facts are not actually interesting and forgot after less than 17 seconds.
