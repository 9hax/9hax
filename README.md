### Current projects

I recently picked up working in IT and noticed that there were no great free and portable ticket system solutions yet, so I started building one. 
It's called [SimpleTicket](https://github.com/9hax/simpleticket) and you can help me build the best open ticket system ever by contributing.

If you find me in a discord server, try out my 9haxbot.

Under the name [berlinkeys](https://github.com/berllinkeys) I am currently designing a custom 120% keyboard which you can build yourself.
We will release it when the first parts of design are done.
